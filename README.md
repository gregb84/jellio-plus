Stream your Jellyfin library directly in Stremio with seamless integration

Jellio+ is a modern fork of [Vanchaxy's original Jellio plugin](https://github.com/vanchaxy/jellio), updated and enhanced for **Jellyfin 10.11.x** compatibility. This plugin creates a bridge between your Jellyfin media server and Stremio, allowing you to stream your personal media library directly within the Stremio interface.

## Features

This fork is updated for **Jellyfin 10.11.2**.

- **Full Library Integration** - Access your entire Jellyfin movie and TV show collection in Stremio

- **Cross-Platform** - Works on all Stremio-supported devices (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS)

- **Jellyseer Integration** - Optional integration with Jellyseer for content requests
  
- **Multiple Formats** - Supports various video codecs and quality options.


## How it Works:



### Browsing Your Library in Stremio

Jellio+ allows you to instantly stream media from your Jellyfin server through Stremio. Simply search for the media in Stremio, and if it is on your Jellyfin server, it will apear!
